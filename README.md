# Healthcare Delivery Process Optimization

This project analyzes and optimizes the **Healthcare Delivery Process** in hospitals and clinics.  
It focuses on improving patient flow, reducing waiting times, and ensuring efficient utilization of staff and medical resources.

---

## Overview
The Healthcare Delivery Process Management System monitors and manages:
- Patient registration
- Consultations
- Laboratory tests
- Treatments and discharge

It provides real-time insights into patient flow and resource utilization to improve operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Hospitals often face inefficiencies during peak hours, leading to:
- Long patient waiting times  
- Overloaded medical staff  
- Underutilized resources in certain departments  
- Delays in diagnosis and treatment  

---

## Performance Objectives
- Reduce patient waiting time  
- Improve throughput of patients per day  
- Identify bottlenecks in registration, consultation, or treatment stages  
- Optimize resource allocation (doctors, nurses, equipment)  
- Ensure scalability during high patient inflow or emergencies
